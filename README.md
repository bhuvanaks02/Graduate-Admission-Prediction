# Graduate-Admission-Prediction

This project involves data exploration and visualization followed by a comparative analysis of four machine learning algorithmsâ€”Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Classifier, and K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier. The objective is to identify the best-performing algorithm for the given dataset. The analysis will provide valuable insights for informed decision-making and model selection.
The four algorithms involved are Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest classifier and K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier.<br>

Install the libraries using the requirements.txt file in the repo and run main.py. Command to run the requirements.txt file:<br>
